# Making Movo Dance

*Final project for CS2951X: Reintegrating AI
Fall 2021*

## Who are you? What is this?
Hi there! I'm Megan Gessner, and this here is the very last thing I do for my Masters degree at Brown. I've been studying CS here for over 5 years now, mostly visual computing and AI, while balancing my passion for dance and choreography. It's been quite the journey trying to reconcile these interests, and I've made a few cool projects towards this end (3D convolutional neural net for transcribing tap dance, a fake Just Dance game with the Kinect, playing with motion capture systems, evaluating dance visualization software), but this particular project emerged in response to the development of the new Choreorobotics 0101 class (offered Spring 2022).

I thought, "oh cool, robots dancing, let's go, I'll just simulate them in Unity, I got my one semester of robotics under my belt, no problem. Once I have it simulated I can use all my AI/machine learning training to do super neat computational creative stuff". Yeah nope, it was extremely difficult and I totally failed, and felt deeply discouraged. I had these big dreams to co-choreograph with a robotic agent and have improvisation sessions where we interacted and learned from each other, but that all was entirely inaccessible so long as the robot was stationary. 

So I vowed that I wouldn't give up, and used this class as an opportunity to take a step forward in this process. In order to eventually get to all the cool stuff I wanted to do that felt dancerly and artistic, I needed to trudge through a whole lot of challenges that were totally outside of my wheelhouse: familiarizing myself with an overwhelmingly large software stack for the MOVO robot, becoming more fluent in ROS and control theory so as to understand what the heck was going on, wrestling with virtual machines and package management and environment configuration, not to mention resolving buttloads of errors that didn't make any sense... it was all painful. **But I did it.** And you can too! That's why I'm writing this documentation of my code, my process, my insights, and my thoughts about future work

My output won't seem all that impressive, but it meets the goal and gets the job done (and it took a lot of work to get there). It is a simulation of a robot that can dance *on beat* with arbitrary movements.
